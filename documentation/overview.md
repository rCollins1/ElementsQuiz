# Elements Quiz: Overview #

The original (and current) Elements Quiz is built as a flash player, rendering its updating process and maintenance both expensive and inconvenient. 
This project was created as a stand-in for the current quiz.

### Our Goal ###

Re-create the Elements Quiz using resources that cut third-party maintenance costs by making it accessible and easy to update regularly, without sacrificing any of its original functionality. 

### Our Solution ###

Using JavaScript (jQuery, AJAX, Chart.js) and HTML/CSS, data is read from a dynamic JSON file, and elements of the quiz are built.
