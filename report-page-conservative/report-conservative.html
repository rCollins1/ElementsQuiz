			<div class="profile">
			<h3 class="title">Your investment profile</h3>
			<p>Your investment profile has been created from a combination of your long-term investment objectives, your risk tolerance and your investment time horizon.
			</p>
			<h4 class="sub-title">Investment objectives &#45;</h4>
			<p>As a conservative investor, your primary investment objective is to provide a balance between the stability of fixed income and a moderate degree of long-term capital appreciation. You want to achieve this goal over a shortto medium-term time horizon.</p>
			<p>Determining the appropriate level of risk in your portfolio is important because your expected rate of return is directly dependent upon the amount of risk you assume. As a general rule for all investments, the higher the risk, the higher the expected rate of return.
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="tolerance">
			<h3 class="title">Your risk tolerance</h3>
			<p>Determining the appropriate level of risk in your portfolio is important because your expected rate of return is directly dependent upon the amount of risk you assume. As a general rule for all investments, the higher the risk, the higher the expected rate of return.</p>
			<p>You have indicated to me that you are willing to accept a low-to-medium level of risk. This level of risk is typically associated with investments in balanced funds and global or corporate fixed income funds.
			</p>
			<h4 class="sub-title">Portfolio objectives &#45;</h4>
			<p><strong>AGF Elements Conservative Portfolio/Class</strong>
			is constructed to provide steady long-term returns with lower risk by investing primarily in a diversified mix of bonds, income and equity mutual funds. The Portfolio invests in a combination of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that provide exposure to Canadian and foreign markets.

		<h5>Disclaimers:</h5>
		<p>This Portfolio Policy Statement is not to be considered investment advice or replace Know Your Client or any other disclosures that may be required by securities regulators or dealer head offices. This Portfolio Policy Statement is to be used solely as a helpful tool by advisors in positioning the portfolio they have chosen (based on investment needs, investor suitability and long-term financial goals) to their clients. Investors should seek the independent advice of a financial advisor when making any investment decisions.</p>
		<p>Commissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) investments. You should read the prospectus carefully before investing. Mutual funds, ETFs and portfolios are not guaranteed; their values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.</p>
		<p>The All World Tax Advantage Group is a mutual fund corporation that currently offers approximately 20 different classes of securities. In addition to fund diversification by investment style, geography and market capitalization, a key benefit of investing in any of the classes within the group is the possibility of sharing incurred expenses (and losses) of the combined structure potentially offsetting income earnings to minimize chance of a dividend declaration. For a more detailed explanation, please see AGF.com/disclaimers.</p>
		<p>The targeted annual distribution (if applicable) is based on the Fund&#39;s or Portfolio&#39;s previous year-end net asset value and is subject to change. Monthly distributions on Series T and Series V shares may generally be a return of capital so long as there is sufficient capital attributable to the relevant series. Your adjusted cost base will be reduced by the amount of any returns of capital. If your adjusted cost base falls below zero, you will have to pay capital gains tax on the amount below zero.</p>
		<p>The payment of distributions should not be confused with a fund&#39;s performance, rate of return or yield. If distributions paid by the fund are greater than the performance of the fund, your original investment will shrink. Distributions paid as a result of capital gains realized by a fund, and income and dividends earned by a fund, are taxable in your hands in the year they are paid. Your adjusted cost base will be reduced by the amount of any returns of capital. If your adjusted cost base falls below zero, you will have to pay capital gains tax on the amount below zero.</p>
		<p>Investors must place a minimum of $100,000 per fund in each account in order to qualify for purchase into AGF Gold Label (Series Q and/or W). Management fees (for Series Q and W) as well as service fees (for Series Q only) within the AGF Gold Label program will be taken out directly from client accounts. For AGF Gold Label clients, AGF pays the operating expenses, custody and other administration-related costs (except brokerage commissions, counterparty fees, IRC fees or other extraordinary items). Tier level discounts apply only to the dollar amount(s) grouped in each particular tier.</p>
